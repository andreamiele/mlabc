    "\n",
    "Classification is a supervised learning task in which the goal is to assign input data points to one of several discrete categories. Examples include spam detection, image classification, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used classification metrics are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Let's define these metrics mathematically:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Accuracy = \\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number of true negatives, FP is the number of false positives, and FN is the number of false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions. It is defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall** measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives. It is defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1-score** is a weighted average of precision and recall, which balances the trade-off between them. It is defined as:\n",

    "F1\\text{-}score = 2\\times\\frac{Precision\\times Recall}{Precision+Recall}\n",
