# ABCs of Machine Learning: A Student's Journey

Hello and welcome to my personal book, ABCs of Machine Learning!

As a Master's student in the field of machine learning, I've been on a fascinating journey of discovery and learning. Through this book, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and knowledge with others who are also interested in this exciting and rapidly-evolving field.

This book is a collection of my notes, musings, and resources that I've gathered throughout my journey. It is meant to be a beginner-friendly guide to the world of machine learning, covering everything from the basics of algorithms to advanced concepts like neural networks and deep learning.

My hope is that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, professionals, and anyone interested in learning about machine learning. I also welcome feedback and suggestions, so feel free to open a pull request or reach out to me with any thoughts or ideas.

Please note that this book is created purely for educational purposes, and any opinions or views expressed in it are solely my own. I am constantly learning and growing, and I hope you'll join me on this exciting journey into the world of machine learning.

Let's get started!


## About


Its content is inspired by a large number of sources, from which numerous ideas and several illustrations were borrowed (more details [here](./reference/acknowledgments.md)).

Demonstrations and challenges leverage the essential tools of the Python ecosystem for Machine Learning: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Usage

All chapters are written as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) combining explanations and example code. When teaching, I use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to showcase them as live presentations.

The content of this site is designed to be browsed thematically rather than sequentially.
