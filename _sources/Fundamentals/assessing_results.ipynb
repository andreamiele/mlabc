    "Classification is a supervised learning task in which the goal is to assign input data points to one of several discrete categories. Examples include spam detection, image classification, and sentiment analysis.\n",

    "**Precision** measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions. It is defined as:\n",
    "$$Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$\n",
